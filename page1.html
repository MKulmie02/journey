        <p>As of right now this is the most advanced website I've made with the little skills that I have. Of course, I do <br>still have a long way to go before I am able to really create a website that is<br>responsive and useful for others, as well as myself. Until then, monitor my progress if you'd like, by visiting this <br>site every so often. I will update this everytime I learn something new.</p>
